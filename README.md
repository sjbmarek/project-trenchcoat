# Welcome to Creeper Index

https://srcorbetto.github.io/project-trenchcoat/

Creeper Index is a simple tool that lets you find out how creepy someone is.

The app takes three inputs:  
1. Your impression of the target person
2. Some text they have authored
3. A photo of their face.

The analysis uses an assigned number rating to the impression, a text anlysis that includes the length of the longest word and the average word length, and a combination of a few facial recognition factors called from Kairos API.

The output is a consolidated score of creepiness and a log (Firebase and local storage) of all the people you have rated using the app.

Challenges involved:
   - Github  - managin revisitions and branches
   - Photo API
   - Project scope
   - Twitter API - delay in getting a key and the required platform to use it
  
  
Additions/Modifications could be:
  - User login
  - Twitter API to access text
  - Additional input validation
  - User experience rating in the log
  - Additonal input validation
